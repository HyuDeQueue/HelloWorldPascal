# Hello World in Free Pascal

This is just a fun repository created to display a simple text "Hello, World!" on a program written in Free Pascal when I was bored. Pascal is an old programming language, even though it's not commonly used today, it still holds historical importance in the evolution of programming.

## Why do i do this?

Just for fun! I created this repository just to demonstrate how simple and straightforward Pascal can be, even decades after its creation.

## To compile and run the code

- Requires the Free Pascal compiler (FPC).
- Compile and run using basic terminal commands.

Enjoy this little nostalgic programming trip!
